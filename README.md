Code for my thesis project's analysis, using representational similarity analysis and bootstrap simulation on 7T fMRI data.

Enclosed are functions for bootstrap simulation, wrangling and visualisation of the RDMs that were written by me.

## Branches:
In the main branch, you will find the scripts that I run different functions from, which are found in the sub-branches "visualise-RDM" and "bootstrap".

## Thesis synopsis:
Thesis title: Investigating cross-modal visual to haptic sensory interactions of familiar and unfamiliar objects in the somatosensory cortex.

Predictive coding is a theory that the brain actively makes predictions about sensory input, based on internal models built from prior knowledge.
Visual input to haptic information of familiar objects can be predictively elicited in the somatosensory cortex, but not unfamiliar objects.
This project investigated whether unfamiliar haptic object information could be cross-modally evoked after training, using fMRI and the following statistical methods:

- Representational similarity analysis, a method of multivariate pattern analysis;
- Bootstrap analysis for experimental simulation.
